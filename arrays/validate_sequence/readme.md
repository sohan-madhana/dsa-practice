# Question

## Give two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

### Note: A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessary adjacent in the array but that are in the same order as in the array.

### Input: 
#### array = [3,5,-4,8,11,1,-1,6]
#### sequence = [5,1,6]

### Output: true
